I am not entirely happy with the template from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
But it is up and running at least. 
Unlike [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) presented [here](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/) which fails because Ruby gems that are not available to github-pages.
This [promise](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/making-github-pages-work-with-latest-jekyll/) did not live up to expectations.
