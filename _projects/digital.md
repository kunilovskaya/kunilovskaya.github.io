<h4 class="title">Cultural Trends in Tyumen Region: National and Global Contexts</h4>


<h5 class="title">Abstract</h5>

This project aims to develop a new empirical approach to explore cultural life in a given region. It is built around a 5-mln-strong database of records about cultural events. 
The records were acquired from specialised websites that aggregated announcements, such as open government archives, commercial databases and social networks.
