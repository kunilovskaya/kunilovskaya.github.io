From 17 May 2023, I have joined the Editorial Board of the journal. We have a new generation of editorial assistants and new workflows introduced. My role as an editorial assistant has shrunk a lot. UpD: I left the Editorial Assistants Team in March 2024. It was a great experience.

As part of voluntary community service, I help to edit the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering" target="blank">Journal of Natural Language Engineering</a>

My main responsibility is securing reviewers for the journal submissions and communicating with the authors and the reviewers.
