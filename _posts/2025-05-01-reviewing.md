<h2 class="title">before the next batch of reviews</h2>

A lot of my time and effort goes into reviewing. This is another voluntary community service that is important to me. 
I find reviewing enriching and enlightening. For me, it is a great opportunity to reflect on the developments in the field 
and to broaden my knowledge. I think I benefit from reading both great and not-so-great submissions -- for various reasons.

The difficult thing is to find time to do the reading without being distracted by other competing tasks. The best setting for me is on the train or on a fight.
And I am very happy with my recent acquisition -- Kindle Scribe -- bought specifically for reviewing and note-taking at the conferences.
