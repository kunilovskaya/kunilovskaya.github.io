<h2 class="title">after several years of no teaching obligations</h2>

I am firmly back at the other side of the classroom. This semester I am teaching my own seminar "Quality in Human and Machine Translation" 
(attended by 8 MA students with various backgrounds) and BA Abschlussarbeit Kolloquium (with Annemarie Verkerk).
Well, I am also a reasonably active student in the formal German classes for the 5th semester, learning at the challenging B2-C1 level.

I keep thinking that learning-teaching might truly be my thing. 
I enjoy the excitement and the challenge of the discovery and of telling an accessible story.
This might be psychologically more rewarding than lonely toiling on a research project which also returns disappointing results.
