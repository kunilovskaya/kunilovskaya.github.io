I've just finished assembling the first full draft of the RANLP-2025 Conference Programme and Proceedings, inc. Preface (to appear <a href="https://ranlp.org/ranlp2025/" target="blank">here</a>).
It was quite an effort. As I wondered why I volunteered to do this for the third time (2021, 2023, 2025), I realised it matters to me to be part of something larger than my own projects.
Arranging over 170 accepted papers thematically is also a valuable birdâ€™s-eye update on developments in the field--it keeps me in touch with where things are heading.
Will I take this on again in 2027? Not sure yet. But I definitely plan to write a Mastodon post about some longitudinal observations I've made along the way.
