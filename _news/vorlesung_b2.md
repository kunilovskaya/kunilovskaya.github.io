-- (1) Had a glimpse of the best part of my past life, when I gave a 90 min lecture as part of BA Vorlesung Perspektiven der Linguistik. Oh my, I miss that! <a href="assets/pdf/perspektiven_translation_handout.pdf" target="blank">(handout)</a>
Title: Predictability of Microsyntactic Units across Slavic Languages: A Translation-based Study.<br>
(2) On the same day, 15 min after the lecture, I had to take the spoken part of the exam at German B2 level. That went surprisingly well.
