-- This semester, except for my own seminar on translation quality, 
I also co-teach P4: Abschlusskolloquium for BA Language Science with Annemarie Verkerk. Today I talked about structuring Related, reference managers and note-taking tools.
This is a truly rewarding experience I must say. Not only you get to understand things in more depth and realise that you actually have a lot to share, 
but also it feels like the students were excited about these instruments.
