-- How often do you spot flaws in a camera-ready when preparing slides?
I just spent three days fixing issues and double-checking details, which led me to rewrite and rearrange most of the paper. Truth be told, I was skeptical about this project from the very beginning.
It turned out to be cognitively intense and at times mind-boggling: applying KLD to compare spoken and written versions of the same source input. On top of that, it wasn't exactly cost-effective--the effort far outweighed the results.
And yet, strangely enough, I ended up content with the outcome. Maybe it's just a cognitive distortion: the harder you work on something, the more satisfying the result feels.
