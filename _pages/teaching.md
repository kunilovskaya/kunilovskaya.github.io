The most recent course - <a href="https://github.com/kunilovskaya/dskills_workshop" target="_blank">Digital Skills for Research</a>


In July 2021 I completed the three-module programme of Postgraduate Certificate "Academic Practice in Higher Education"
and was awarded a Fellowship in Higher Education Academy (<a href="assets/pdf/Maria Kunilovskaya_FHEA.pdf" target="blank">FHEA</a>)
This is a <a href="https://youtu.be/g8CbG7WtHeI" target="blank">video of my introduction</a> for one of the modules.
