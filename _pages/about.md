I completed my first PhD (Candidate of Science) in Contrastive Linguistics in 2004 (adviser: Olga Brodovich, Saint Petersburg University).

In 2019, I left an Associate Professor position at a Translation Studies department to do a PhD research on human translation quality estimation.

My research is focused on computational approaches in translationese studies, building <a href="https://www.rus-ltc.org/static/html/about.html" target="_blank">learner parallel</a> and comparable corpora.

**Keywords:**
<ul>
    <li>translation quality estimation, learner translations, error annotation;</li>
    <li>machine learning, distributional semantics</li>
    <li>languages varieties, register studies, text complexity</li>
    <li>digital humanities</li>
</ul>
