I am currently a postdoc with University of Saaland (Germany) working on modelling mediated language to explore the memory-surprisal trade-off hypothesis from information theory. 
My PhD (completed March 2023, supervisor: Prof. Mitkov, <a href="http://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/" target="_blank">RGCL</a>, UK) was on human translation quality estimation.

Before that I held an Associate Professor position at a Translation Studies department, lecturing in Translation Studies, Theoretical Linguistics and Corpus Linguistics.
I have a PhD (Candidate of Science) in Contrastive Linguistics (completed 2004, adviser: Prof. Brodovich, Saint Petersburg University).

A lot of my efforts were invested in building <a href="https://www.rus-ltc.org/static/html/about.html" target="_blank">learner parallel</a> and comparable corpora, as well as other language resources. 
I have extensive experience in setting up manual annotation experiments.

My research interests have shifted from corpus- and feature-based approaches to ML, modelling and representation learning.
In the past few years, I was involved in computational humanities projects.
